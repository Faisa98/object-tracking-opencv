# ðŸŽ¯ Object Tracking with OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to track a selected object in a video using OpenCV's built-in tracking algorithms.  
The user selects a region in the first frame, and the tracker follows it through the rest of the video.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-contrib-python` for tracking modules)

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. The script opens a video file.
2. The user selects the object to track in the first frame.
3. OpenCV's tracker (default: `CSRT`) begins following the object.
4. A green rectangle shows the tracked object in each frame.
